# Keygasm
One day a friend talked to me about getting an Ahegao keycap set for their mechanical keyboard.
Another one said he woudl do that only if his keyboard would emit *\*some noise*\* when any key is pressed.
And it was at that moment, that I realized, the world needs something like that.

## WTF is this?
Nothing more, nothing less than a windows service that intercepts all of the keys pressed and plays a soundfile associated with it.

## Does it work yet?
Nope, but I'm working on it. Windows services are finiky to get right to work.


### FAQ
##### I would have done this in python,it would be much easier
Go ahead and do it. I don't like python for multiple reasons.

##### Can I help?
Sure. Feel free to send a pull request or open an issue.

##### Does this really need to be a windows service?
Thinking about it, no. I'm pretty much using this project to experiment with some parts of C# and windows development that I never touched. I may abandon the idea of doing a windows service altogether if this starts to be a bigger headache than it should be.
